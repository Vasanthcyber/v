Using the uploaded image as reference, create a fine-art fashion editorial scene of a figure seated low on a minimalist metal stool, legs extended forward in a relaxed, grounded posture, feet planted evenly, one hand resting loosely between the knees holding thin leather reins, shoulders slightly slouched and head tilted downward in a calm, introspective pose; the subject wears dark oversized layered clothing, wide-leg trousers, leather boots, and dark sunglasses. A powerful black horse stands close behind the seated figure, aligned protectively and partially overlapping their silhouette. The setting is an open, natural landscape with sparse wild grasses and rounded forms beneath a bright, overexposed sky that creates strong negative space and high-contrast lighting. The overall look is cinematic and timeless, with soft highlights, matte texture, subtle film grain, and a monochrome fine-art aesthetic, evoking luxury fashion photography and editorial elegance.
